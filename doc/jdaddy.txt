USAGE                                           *jdaddy*

                                                *ij*
ij                      Text object for innermost JSON number, string, array,
                        object, or keyword (including but not limited to
                        true/false/null).

                                                *aj*
aj                      Text object for outermost JSON object or array.

                                                *gqij*
gqij                    Replace the innermost JSON with a pretty printed
                        version.

                                                *gqaj*
gqaj                    Replace the outermost JSON with a pretty printed
                        version.

                                                *gwij*
["x]gwij                Merge the JSON from the register into the innermost
                        JSON.  Merging extends objects, concatenates strings
                        and arrays, and adds numbers.

                                                *gwaj*
["x]gwaj                Merge the JSON from the register into the outermost
                        JSON.

Pretty printing indents based on 'shiftwidth' and wraps at 'textwidth'.
