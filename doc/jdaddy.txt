USAGE                                           *jdaddy*

ij                      Text object for innermost JSON number, string, array,
                        object, or keyword (including but not limited to
                        true/false/null).

                                                *aj*
aj                      Text object for outermost JSON object or array.

                                                *gqij*

                        version.

                        version.

["x]gwaj                Merge the JSON from the register into the outermost
                        JSON.

gsj                     Convert the JSON into a string. 


Pretty printing indents based on 'shiftwidth' and wraps at 'textwidth'.
